### Calendar Maker

This is a simple program that creates a basic calendar in the format I prefer. It automatically calculates the date for the start of each week to save me time. 

All that is needed is a start and end date for the calendar. The user has the option to include weekends and to add events to specific days.

Format:

mm/dd  
M -  
T -  
W -  
T -  
F -  
S -  
S -
